"""
Odoo CRM leads sync -> Supabase leads_unified (source_system='odoo').

Ongoing, incremental sync. Designed to run as a Railway Cron Job (see
deployment notes) — not a persistent loop like smartfleet_sync.py, since
this workload has no live-data or time-of-day requirement and is fully
stateless between runs (all state lives in the `sync_state` table).

SCOPE — hard floor, applies to the first run too:
    Only crm.lead records with create_date >= ODOO_LEADS_START_DATE are ever
    pulled. Older leads are permanently excluded, not just skipped on later
    runs.

NO 'status' COLUMN — leads_unified doesn't have one. Won/Lost/Pending are
derived at query time from stage_name + is_active:
    Won:     stage_name = 'Won'                (both sources)
    Lost:    (sheets) stage_name = 'Lost'  |  (odoo) is_active = false
    Pending: (odoo only) is_active = true AND stage_name != 'Won'
This script's only responsibility is writing stage_name and is_active
accurately — it does not compute or write any won/lost/status value itself.

WON DETECTION (odoo) — driven by crm.stage.is_won, not by name-matching.
Some pipelines have more than one stage that counts as won (e.g. a repeat-
business stage) which isn't literally named "Won". Any stage flagged
is_won=True in Odoo has its stage_name normalized to the literal string
"Won" when written here, so stage_name = 'Won' stays a reliable filter
for every consumer of this table regardless of how many won-type stages
exist in Odoo.

Required env vars (never hardcode):
